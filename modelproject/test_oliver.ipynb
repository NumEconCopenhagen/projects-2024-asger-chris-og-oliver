    "$e^r_t$: The (log) real exchange rate, which is given by the real exchange rate in previous period plus the difference in price level in period t ($\\pi^f-\\pi_t$). The real interest rate denotes the price level in the world compared to domestic price levels in the same currency. The interpretation is that $e_t^r$ denotes the real price of 1 unit of a foreign good in units of domestic goods; i.e. a $e_t^r$ of 0.7 means that we can get 0.7 foreign goods in exchange of 1 domestic good. There are effects both ways in regards of $e_t^r$: The higher the $e_t^r$, the domestic economy is more competitive, as foreign goods are relatively more expensive than domestic goods. On the other hand, the higher the $e_t^r$, the less foreign goods we can get in exchange of domestic goods, as domestic goods are relatively cheaper, so our trading capabilities are worse.\n",
