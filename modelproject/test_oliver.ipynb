    "__The AD curve (1):__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aggregate Demand curve represents the total demand for all goods and services in an economy at different price levels, holding all else constant. The higher the real exchange rate $e^r_{t-1}$, the more expensive it is to buy foreign goods, increasing inflation for a given $e^r_{t-1}$, shifting the AD-curve upwards. The higher the foreign inflation $\\pi^f$, the higher the domestic inflation for a given $\\pi^f$, shifting the AD-curve upwards. If there is a positive demand shock, i.e. the term $\\frac{z_t}{\\beta_1}$, there is a higher demand for a given inflation level, shifting the AD-cruve upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we turn to the term $-\\frac{1}{\\beta_1}(y_t-\\bar{y})$, which shows that the AD curve is downward-sloping, indicating that lower price levels increase the overall demand for goods and services and vice versa. Why is the AD curve downwards sloping, i.e. why is there a negative correlation between inflation and outputgap in the AD curve? There are a number of factors explaining this, some of the most dynamics being as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The foreign trade effect. The lower the price level, the cheaper the domestic goods, resulting in an increasing demand for domestic goods and thus a positive output gap as domestic production increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The Wealth effect. The lower the price level, the more goods can be bought for a given amount of wealth, increasing production and output gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The interest rate effect. The higher the price level, the more wealth is needed to buy, goods, increasing the competition for borrowing money, which increases the interest rates. The increased interest rates slows down the economy, resulting in a negative output gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Short-Run AS curve (2):__\n",
    "\n",
    "The AS curve denotes the aggregate supply function in the economy, modelling a positive relation between inflation in period t, and current output gap. The intuition is straightforward: If $\\pi^f$ increases, domestic inflation increases, shifting the AS curve upwards as production becomes more expensive, lowering the supply for a given inflation level. If there is a positive supply shock, $s_t>0$, the AS curve shifts upwards, as the production lowers ???????????????????????????????????????????????????\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the term $\\gamma(y_t-\\bar{y})$ shows that there is a positive relation between outputgap and inflation levels. If price levels in the economy increases, and the costs of production for the producers does not increase at the same rate, there is an incentive to produce more, resulting in a positive output gap. \n",
    "\n",
    "__ The Real Exchange Rate:__\n",
    "$e^r_t$: The (log) real exchange rate, which is given by the real exchange rate in previous period plus the difference in price level in period t ($\\pi^f-\\pi_t$). The real interest rate denotes the price level in the world compared to domestic price levels in the same currency. The interpretation is that $e_t^r$ denotes the real price of 1 unit of a foreign good in units of domestic goods; i.e. a $e_t^r$ of 0.7 means that we can get 0.7 foreign goods in exchange of 1 domestic good. There are effects both ways in regards of $e_t^r$: The higher the $e_t^r$, the domestic economy is more competitive, as foreign goods are relatively more expensive than domestic goods. On the other hand, the higher the $e_t^r$, the less foreign goods we can get in exchange of domestic goods, as domestic goods are relatively cheaper, so our trading capabilities are worse.\n"
